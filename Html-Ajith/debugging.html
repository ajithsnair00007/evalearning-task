<p>What causes errors in HTML?

<ul>
  <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly,
      then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend

  <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
      for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasized?</strong>
      what is this?</em>

  <p>For HTML debugging we can use <strong style="color: red;">MARK UP VALIDATION SERVICE</strong></p>
</ul>
