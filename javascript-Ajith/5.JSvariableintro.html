    <h1>VARIABLES Introduction</h1>
    <p>In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
        The data can be of any data types like string, numbers, etc.</p>

    <h1>Declaring variables.</h1>
    <p>In Javascript, it is necessary to declare a variable before we can use them in our program.
        Declaring a variable means creating a variable.
        We use the keywords var and let for declaring a variable in javascript.</p>

    <h1>Initialising Variables</h1>
    <p>Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization.
        We can initialize a variable at the time of variable declaration or at a later point in time when we need that variable.
        We use the assignment operator "=" to assign a value to the variable.</p>

    <h1>Outputting the variables</h1>
    <p>Once you have stored the data inside a variable, you can output or print the value inside it by calling the name of the variable.</p>

    <h1>Undefined</h1>
    <p>If we try to output a variable without assigning any value to it, we will get value as undefined.
        The value can be something that has to be calculated or something that will be provided later, like user input.</p>
