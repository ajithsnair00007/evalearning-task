         defined by their respective edges: the <b>content edge</b>, 
         <b>padding edge</b>,<b>border edge</b>, and <b>margin edge</b> .</p>

    <h3>Different Parts</h3>

        <li><b> Content </b>- The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
        <li><b> Padding</b>- Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
        <li><b> Border </b>- A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
        <li><b> Margin </b>- Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent. </li>
